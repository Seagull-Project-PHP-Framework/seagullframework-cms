# Unfortunately SVN doesn't support externals for files (only for directories).
# To hack this we export some SGL files to CMS project directory. We do
# not add them to CMS repo to avoid headache with sync.
#
# CMS should be a part (extension/module/feature/plugin you name it) of SGL
# - this is our goal. Currently it is vice versa, CMS uses SGL. As soon as
# default_admin2 is merged with main SGL, old CMS is replaced with new
# SimpleCMS, this step would be not necessary (it'd be completely different
# setup).
#
# Small comment to devs. I don't think we can achieve this with bugfix though.
# To make CMS a part of SGL current bugfix branch should be significally
# modified, what we don't want. Things should become normal only with decent
# SGL 2.0. (Dmitri's point)
#

1. Run etc/setup.sh

2. Run installation wizard

#
# Note to myself (Dmitri):
#
# This warning will be fixed/removed together with setup.php improvement
# and navigation/block module removal/replacement.
#

   a) don't pay attention on "undefined constant" error

#
# Note to myself (Dmitri):
#
# Checkout if we really need this step.
#

3. Login as admin and rebuild with sample data (just to make sure everything is OK)

#
# Below instructions will not be needed as soon as user2 will completely
# supersede user1 module.
#

4. Add/replace below lines in `var/config/user2.ini` under `Login2Mgr` container

   ---
   loginRootGoto      = default^maintenance
   loginModeratorGoto = admin^admin
   ---

   If relevant cached config file doesn't exist, request e.g.
   `index.php/login`, then go back - it should be created (grant write permissions)

5. Create a symlink from the global config file in var to localhost.conf.php

6. Login via user2 module

    a) goto index.php/login
    b) do login: moderator, password: qwerty
